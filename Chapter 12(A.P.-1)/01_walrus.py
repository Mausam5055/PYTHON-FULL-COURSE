# ---------CHAPTER 12 â€“ ADVANCED PYTHON 1-------

#         ----NEWLY ADDED FEATURES IN PYTHON---

# Following are some of the newly added features in Python programming
# language

# WALRUS OPERATOR:

# The walrus operator (:=), introduced in Python 3.8, allows you to 
# assign values to variables as part of an expression. This operator,
# named for its resemblance to the eyes and tusks of a walrus, is 
# officially called the "assignment expression."

# # Using walrus operator
# if (n := len([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])) > 3:
# print(f"List is too long ({n} elements, expected <= 3)")

# # Output: List is too long (5 elements, expected <= 3)

# In this example, n is assigned the value of len([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) 
# and then used in the comparison within the if statement

# Using walrus operator 
if (n := len([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])) > 3: 
    print(f"List is too long ({n} elements, expected <= 3)") 

    # Output: List is too long (5 elements, expected <= 3)
#we can shorten out a loong code using the walrus operator
#(doing a two line code in single line)
