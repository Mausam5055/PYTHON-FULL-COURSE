# ---------TYPES DEFINITIONS IN PYTHON-------

# Type hints are added using the colon (:) syntax for variables and 
# the -> syntax for function return types.

# # Variable type hint
# age: int = 25
# # Function type hints
# def greeting(name: str) -> str:
# return f"Hello, {name}!"
# # Usage
# print(greeting("Alice")) # Output: Hello, Alice!

n : int = 5 #we said python that n is a integer here
#bow if we type jst "n." we will get all the methods of integer

n.  #(remove it and write it again by yourself to see the methods of integer)

# similarly,
       # (another example):

name: str  = "Harry"  #(here str means string )i.e. the name we wrote is a string 
name.  #(remove it and write it again by yourself to see the methods of string)
