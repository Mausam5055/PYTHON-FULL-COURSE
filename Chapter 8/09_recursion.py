# ----RECURSION-----
 
# Recursion is a function which calls itself.
# It is used to directly use a mathematical formula as function.

# Example:
# factorial(n) = n x factorial (n-1)
# This function can be defined as follows:
# def factorial(n)
# if i == 0 or i==1: # base condition which doesnâ€™t call the function 
# any further
# return 1
# else:
#  return n*factorial(n-1) # function calling itself
