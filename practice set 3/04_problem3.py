# 3. Write a program to detect double space in a string.
name = "Harry is a good  boy and  "

print(name.find("  ")) #inside double quote we placed double space


# NOTES: here str function 'name.find' is used for this purpose
#        ----name.find---
#inside the string the double space starts after 15th letter so
#after running the code we get the output as 15
