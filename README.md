## Code Examples

Here are a few basic examples to get you started with Python:

### 1. Hello World (hello_world.py)

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

#### Running the example:

1. Open the `hello_world.py` file.
2. Run the script using:

    ```bash
    python hello_world.py
    ```

---

### 2. Variables and Data Types (variables.py)

```python
# Variables and data types in Python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
height = 5.5
is_student = True

print(f"Name: {name}")
print(f"Age: {age}")
print(f"Height: {height}")
print(f"Student: {is_student}")
```

---

### 3. Functions (functions.py)

```python
# Function to calculate the sum of two numbers
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 10)
print(f"Sum: {result}")
```

---

## Exercises

Here are a few exercises to practice after going through the sections:

1. **Write a program that asks for your name and age and prints a greeting.**
2. **Create a program that calculates the factorial of a number using a loop.**
3. **Write a function that checks if a number is prime.**
4. **Create a class called `Car` with attributes like make, model, and year, and a method to display car information.**
5. **Implement a program that reads a file, counts the number of words, and prints the result.**
