# ---TUPLE---
# A tuple is an immutable data type in python.
# a = () # empty tuple
# a = (1,) # tuple with only one element needs a comma
# a = (1,7,2) # tuple with more than one element

#TUPLE IS NOTHING BUT JST LIKE A LIST BUT TUPLE IS IMMUTABLE
#WHEREAS LIST IS MUTABLE

#NOTES:1.Immutable list: tuple (written inside 1st bracket)
#      2.Mutable list: list (written inside 3rd bracket)

a = (1,45,342,3424,False, "Rohan", "Shivam")
print(a)
print(type(a))

#if we write a = (1) then its a integer 
#but if we write a = (1,) then its a tuple
