# ---TUPLE METHODS-----

# Consider the following tuple.
# 18
# a = (1, 7, 2)
# • a.count (1): a count (1) will return number of times 1 occurs in a.
# • a.index (1) will return the index of first occurrence of 1 in a

a = (1,45,342,3424,False, 45, "Rohan", "Shivam")
print(a) 

no = a.count(45)
print(no)

i = a.index(3424)
print(i)

print(len(a))

#here no means -- number and i means --- index
