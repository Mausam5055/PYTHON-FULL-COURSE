# variable is the name given to a memory location in a program.
#  For example.
# a= 30 
# variables = container to store a value

a = 1
b = 2
print(a-b)
print("a,b")

# NOTES :1. WE WRITE NAME INSIDE A VARIABLE USING DOUBLE QUOTE (AND IT IS 
# CALLED A STRING )  E.G. LET C BE A VARIABLE
#             SO 'C' = "MAUSAM"
#             HERE THE NAME MAUSAM IS CALLED A  STRING WHICH IS 
#             INSIDE THE VARIABLE (OR CONTAINER ) 'C' 

# 2. WE CAN'T WRITE C = mausam (THIS IS INVALID)
# ONLY FOR WRITTING NUMBERS INSIDE A VARIBALE WE WRITE WITHOUT DOUBLE QUOTE
# I.E.  C = 2  BUT C = mausam (CANT BE WRITTEN)

# 3.VARIABLES ARE ALSO CALLED CONTAINERS
