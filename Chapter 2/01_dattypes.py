# TYPES OF VARIABLES IN PYTHON 

# Primarily these are the following data types in Python:
# 1. Integers
# 2. Floating point numbers
# 3. Strings
# 4. Booleans 
# 5. None
# Python is a fantastic language that automatically 
# identifies the type of data for us.


a = 1 # a is an integer

b = 5.22 # b is a floating point number

c = "Harry" # c is a string

d = False # d is a boolean variable

e = None # e is a none type variable

# NOTES:1. Sometimes we need to mark nothing in a variable so
#          to mark nothing 
#          in a variable we use "none variable"

        # 2. Sometimes we need mark wether the statement is true or  
        # false in our code so to mark this we use boolean variable
