  # Output: Hello, Mausam!


#Note: Python doesn't allow variable names or module names to
# start with a number, so using 02_Module as a module name 
# will lead to an error.

# To fix this, you can rename the module to something that 
# doesn't start with a number. For example, you could 
# rename 02_Module.py to module_02.py or module_two.py.
