# There are two types of Functions In Python :
# 1. User Defined functiion And 
# 2. In Built Function 
# 
# Python contains several inbuilt functions

#1. type()- to check the type of variable
#2. id()- to get address of object.The id() function returns
#the identity (memory address) of an object. It helps to 
#identify the location of an object in memory.

#3. print()- to print the value

a = 5
print(type(a))  # <class 'int'>
print(id(a))  # Prints the memory address of variable 'a'
