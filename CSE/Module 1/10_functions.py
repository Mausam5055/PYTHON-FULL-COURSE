# In Python, functions can be categorized into different 
# types based on their usage and functionality. Here are 
# the main types:

# 1. Built-in Functions
# These are predefined functions in Python that can be 
# used directly.
# Examples: print(), len(), type(), input(), sum(), min(),
# max(), etc.

# 2. User-defined Functions
# Functions that are created by users to perform specific 
# tasks.
# Example :

def greet(name):  # Define a function named 'greet' that takes 'name' as input
    return "Hello, " + name + "!"  # Returns a greeting message

print(greet("Mausam"))  # Calls the function with "Mausam" and prints the result

# Explanation:
# 1.The function greet(name) takes a name as input.
# 2.It returns a greeting message by adding "Hello, " before the name.
# 3.print(greet("Mausam")) calls the function and prints "Hello, 
# Mausam!"
